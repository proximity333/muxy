# AI notifications

Muxy tracks the AI coding agents running inside its terminals — Antigravity CLI, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Droid, Grok, Kiro CLI, OpenCode, Pi, and Xal — and surfaces their lifecycle as pane and worktree status, completion badges, and notifications when a turn finishes, or — for providers that expose a waiting hook — when an agent needs attention.

There are two independent sources of truth, and hooks are authoritative.

## Detection vs. hooks

- **Hooks** are the primary signal. Each provider's CLI is configured to run a small Muxy hook when it starts a turn, finishes, or needs input. The hook reports the exact lifecycle phase (`working`, `waiting`, `finished`), so status changes are precise and event-driven.
- **Detection** is the fallback. Muxy watches the foreground process of each pane to notice when an agent is running even if its hooks are missing or misconfigured. Detection can tell that an agent *stopped* being the foreground process, but not why.

When detection reports that a working agent is no longer active, Muxy waits a short grace window (4 seconds) for a hook `finished` event before falling back to marking the pane idle. A hook event arriving inside the window always wins, so a correctly hooked agent is never idled prematurely by detection.

A `waiting` pane is handled more conservatively, because a waiting agent still has a live process and must never be idled just for leaving the foreground. It uses a much longer window (30 seconds), and Muxy records the detected process ID before detection is lost. At the end of each window, Muxy idles the pane only if that process is gone; a live process schedules another low-frequency check. This recovers panes whose agent was killed before its `Stop` hook could run, without cutting short an agent that is genuinely waiting on input.

## Session end

Leaving the foreground and exiting are different events. Once detection identifies an agent, Muxy watches that process for exit, so quitting the agent ends its session immediately without polling. Ending a session idles the pane and drops it from the Agents Focused sidebar, while completion badges and notifications from the finished turn stay. A `finished` hook event arriving after the process is gone does not revive the session; the next `working` or `waiting` event, or detecting an agent again, starts a new one. Agents running over SSH are not detected locally, so their sessions end only when the pane closes.

## Protocol (v3)

Hooks talk to Muxy over a Unix domain socket at `~/Library/Application Support/Muxy/muxy.sock` (`muxy-dev.sock` for debug builds). The wire format is a single newline-delimited JSON object per event, acknowledged by the server:

```json
{"v":3,"kind":"agent_event","id":"…","provider":"claude_hook","paneID":"…","phase":"finished","title":"Claude Code","body":"Done","pids":[],"ts":1721234567}
```

- `id` is a UUID identifying one logical event. The bridge generates it once when the message is built and re-sends the identical line on every retry, so a retried event carries the same `id`.
- `paneID` is the target pane. When the CLI cannot know it, the field is omitted and `pids` carries the process's ancestor chain; Muxy resolves the nearest matching pane by foreground process id.
- `phase` is `working`, `waiting`, or `finished`. `finished` maps to the `idle` status.
- `test: true` marks a synthetic event from the settings Test button — it is delivered as a notification but never changes agent status.

The server replies with `{"v":3,"kind":"ack","ok":true}`. Events with the wrong version, wrong kind, empty provider, or a malformed pane id are rejected without an ack. This is the only agent protocol Muxy accepts; there is no pipe-format fallback.

The bridge accepts at most 1 MiB from standard input and uses one monotonic 400 ms execution budget across input reading, socket connection, writes, acknowledgement reads, and retries. Reaching the payload cap returns immediately instead of draining the rest of standard input.

### Duplicate suppression

The bridge retries an event when an ack does not arrive within its delivery budget, so a lost or slow ack can deliver the same event twice. The server remembers the 256 most recently applied `id` values (FIFO eviction) and, on a repeat, still acks so the client stops retrying, then skips the event entirely. Duplicate deliveries do not update agent status, hook health, event time, or notifications. An event with a missing or empty `id` is never deduplicated and is always delivered.

When an AI hook and terminal OSC report the same body and navigation context within two seconds, Muxy coalesces only their macOS desktop-notification delivery. Matching titles and the default completion titles are treated as equivalent for this delivery check. A delivery is suppressed only when exactly one complementary pending ingress matches; ambiguous candidates, including different AI providers, are all delivered. Both notification records remain available to the notification list, API, extensions, and in-app delivery. Extension-origin notifications are not eligible for this coalescing.

A macOS banner is withdrawn once its notification is marked read — switching to the note's tab, reactivating Muxy on it, opening it from the notification panel, or marking it read from a paired phone — and **Clear All** removes every remaining banner. Banners for other unread tabs are left alone.

## Staging layout

The compiled hook bridge (`muxy-hook`) and the provider shims are staged into `~/Library/Application Support/Muxy/hooks` (`hooks-dev` for debug builds) with private permissions:

- `muxy-hook` — the compiled bridge every hook invokes.
- `muxy-antigravity-hook.sh`, `muxy-claude-hook.sh`, `muxy-codex-hook.sh`, `muxy-copilot-hook.sh`, `muxy-cursor-hook.sh`, `muxy-droid-hook.sh`, `muxy-grok-hook.sh`, `muxy-kiro-hook.sh` — thin shell shims that exec the colocated `muxy-hook`.
- `opencode-muxy-plugin.js`, `muxy-pi-extension.ts`, `muxy-xal-plugin.ts` — plugin/extension entry points that spawn the staged `muxy-hook`. When the binary is missing they log a clear error to their own stderr and skip the event. That stderr never reaches Muxy, so nothing restages automatically — use **Refresh** in Settings to restage.

The OpenCode entry point is installed globally at `~/.config/opencode/plugins/muxy-notify.js`. OpenCode loads local plugins at startup, so restart any running OpenCode session after Muxy first installs or repairs this file.

The Xal entry point is installed at `~/.xal/plugins/muxy-notify/plugin.ts` and its directory is added to the `plugins` array in `~/.xal/config.json`, because Xal loads only the plugins that array names. Xal loads plugins at startup, so restart any running Xal session after Muxy installs or repairs them.

Reconciliation starts only after the complete staged resource set is available. Each provider also verifies that the shared `muxy-hook` bridge exists and is executable, so a stale shim or plugin cannot report healthy while its bridge is missing.

Terminals export `MUXY_PANE_ID`, `MUXY_SOCKET_PATH`, `MUXY_HOOK_BIN`, `MUXY_HOOK_SCRIPT`, `MUXY_PROJECT_ID`, and `MUXY_WORKTREE_ID` so shims and plugins can reach the socket and binary and identify their context.

## Health and repair engine

Each provider integration is reconciled declaratively: Muxy **verifies** that every managed event has exactly one current Muxy hook and **repairs** stale or duplicate entries in place when it drifts, preserving any foreign hooks the user configured. Reconciliation runs at launch, when a provider becomes available, and whenever a provider's config file changes — the latter is watched with FSEvents and debounced, so an external edit to `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, and the like triggers an automatic re-verify without polling.

Muxy records a hash of every config file it writes and ignores watcher events whose content matches its own last write, so a repair never re-triggers itself. A per-file rate limiter caps repairs within a rolling minute; when it trips — most commonly when a release and a debug build both manage the same config — Muxy stops rewriting and reports a `conflict` instead of spinning.

Providers that moved to a new config location also declare their obsolete paths. Those are watched alongside the managed ones and deleted on install, so an older Muxy build restoring a superseded copy triggers a repair instead of leaving two live hooks.

Results are tracked per provider in the health store — install state, last verified/repaired time, last event time, and last error — and shown in **Settings → Notifications** as a status dot and line per provider. A `conflict` means Muxy found a non-Muxy hook it will not overwrite; the message names it. Antigravity CLI hooks live in `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`. Copilot CLI hooks live in `~/.copilot/hooks/muxy-notify.json` (or `$COPILOT_HOME/hooks/` when set); restart the CLI after Muxy repairs hooks so the new config is loaded. Kiro CLI hooks live in `~/.kiro/hooks/muxy-notify.json`; global hooks require the CLI's V3 mode (`kiro-cli --v3`), available since CLI 2.13 and standard in CLI 3.0. Kiro loads hooks at session start, so start a new session after Muxy installs or repairs the file. Xal reports `working` and `idle` only: its plugin hooks cover prompt submission and turn completion, but an interrupted or failed turn runs no hook, so a cancelled turn keeps the pane `working` until the next prompt or until detection ends the session. Muxy manages the user-level `~/.xal/config.json`; a project-level `.xal/config.json` that declares its own `plugins` array replaces the user array entirely, and Xal will not load Muxy's plugin in that project.

OpenCode also runs a bounded, read-only `opencode debug info` discovery probe after reconciliation. Its provider row reports the resolved CLI version and whether OpenCode's effective plugin list contains Muxy's exact managed plugin. Discovery results are separate from hook verification and event delivery, and are logged through the `ProviderDiscovery` unified-log category with executable paths kept private.

The OpenCode plugin writes structured `service=muxy` entries to OpenCode's own logs when it initializes, forwards a permission or question, or cannot launch `muxy-hook`. Use `opencode debug paths` to locate the active OpenCode log directory and `opencode debug info` to inspect the effective plugin list manually.

## Test button

Each provider row in **Settings → Notifications** has a **Test** button. It runs the staged `muxy-hook` with `--event test --test`, which sends a `test: true` event over the live socket. The pass/fail signal is the bridge's exit code, so a passing test confirms the delivery path — staged binary, socket, server, and ack — without touching agent status. It does not verify that the resulting in-app notification was presented. **Refresh** restages the provider's hook files and re-runs reconciliation.

## Extension surface

Agent status is exposed to extensions as the `agent.status` event and `muxy.agents.list()`, and completions post `notification.posted`. See [Extension events](../extensions/events.md).

## Troubleshooting

- **No notifications from an agent.** Open **Settings → Notifications**, check the provider's status dot, and click **Refresh** to restage and re-verify. Run **Test** to confirm the socket path end to end.
- **OpenCode still does not report permissions or questions after Refresh.** Restart the OpenCode session so it loads the repaired global plugin from `~/.config/opencode/plugins`.
- **Hook delivery failures.** The bridge logs failures to `~/Library/Application Support/Muxy/hooks.log`.
- **Socket missing.** Verify it exists: `ls -l ~/Library/Application\ Support/Muxy/muxy.sock`.
- **Conflict reported.** Muxy found a foreign hook in the provider's config and left it untouched. Remove or rename it if you want Muxy to own that hook, then **Refresh**.
- **Logs.** Stream live: `log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "app.muxy"' --info --debug`.
- **OpenCode discovery logs.** Filter the provider probe: `log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "app.muxy" AND category == "ProviderDiscovery"' --info --debug`.
